# Search Videos
This is a tiny project created by me for learning purposes.
Checkout the website at https://hashikano.github.io/search-videos/

## What it does...
You can search videos by keywords, YouTube.com's API is used to provide search results and this whole program is created with ReactJS.

## Other *fine details*
I have hard coded to show 8 results (in the next version there will be more results with comments under the video, just like YouTube).

Also, I've used Semantic UI for the css styling (mainly for the Grid system and border box).

## Note from **ME**
You can make changes to the code (obviously, it's open source, you can do whatever you want) but if you do change the code and add new features or fix the old ones, do let me know (maybe share your own repository) and we'll code together :)
